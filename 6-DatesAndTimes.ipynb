There's a minimum value and a maximum value property that you can work with and all kinds of formatting capabilities of a date time variable. We create a new `DateTime` variable by using the `new` keyword and specifying the year month, day, year, and optionally the time information including hour (in 24 hour format), minute, and second.\n",
